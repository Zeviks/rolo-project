In class components not matters what the constructor runs first 

Then comes the render method 

then comes lifecycle methods like componentDidMount.


But in most cases whenever componentDidMount triggers so will the render method since state has been update and we want to keep our 
component up to date.

try the console.log test.

In summary, we first want to initlize our state to set the structure for the site.
Then we render the component 
Then if we need to fetch some data, or update any data we use the useEffect or lifecycle methods which they update our state 
Which then trigger a re-render of the component the UI with the update data. 

This is the core flow of react.
