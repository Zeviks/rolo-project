Hooks - Are very used almost exclusively in react. 

Classes = Is a more general approach, since lots of programming languages are based on OOP. This are the foundations of classes.

Understanding when react is rendering and re-rendering your application is a curcial concept to understand. 

JSX - Was designed in a way that closely resembles HTML, since we're always trying to visualize how our page will look. 
This gives it the functionality of javascript, and the feel of HTML. 


[ State ] : 

State is one of the many ways we can tell react to re-render. Whenever our state has change our page will reload with the update state.

To make use of state we first import it and then use this syntax :

const [nameOfState, setNameOfState] = useState(defaultState);

This is the standard syntax
